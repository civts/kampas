## Adding authentication
looked into rocket's fairings, but derouted on request guards
maybe its in https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/requests/#cookies
wrestled with Pins and Boxes
found the solution on https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/request/trait.FromRequest.html#example-1
I was missing a macro and had imported the wrong Outcome
we got cookies authentication! well, still have to do teh register flow, and I am using cookies instead of API keys


### Changing cookies for API keys
### Add proper logging
### API rate limiting
### Add person to company (register)
